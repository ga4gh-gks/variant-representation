Alternative Models
--

This section of the repo provides a place for members to contribute known forms for computationaly representing variation (i.e VCF, ClinVar, dbSNP etc..)

By identifying and collecting some baseline information about the breadth of solutions it will raise awareness and allow for some level of comparison in terms of benefits and deficiencies for various use cases in sharing variant data.

Each folder should be named based on the common known name for the form of variant representation and have a readme.md file that contains the following...

A description of the origins and basic prinicples or use case that the variant representation serves
Links to the original specification or github project where the variant representation is defined
A conceptual information model describing the structures (main classes and attributes) very high level.
